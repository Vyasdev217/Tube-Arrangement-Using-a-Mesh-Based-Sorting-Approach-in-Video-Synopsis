## Abstract
As the amount of surveillance video keeps growing rapidly, monitoring it has become harder and takes more time. Video synopsis helps by making a compact version of the original video, eliminating spatial and temporal redundancies while retaining all critical activities. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on traditional tube rearrangement strategies, this work proposes a novel mesh-based tube sorting algorithm within a comprehensive video synopsis pipeline. The framework includes object segmentation and tracking using the YOLO11 segmentation model, followed by tube extraction and rearrangement using custom algorithms. Furthermore, a new evaluation metric is introduced to measure tube rearrangement algorithms, with lower computational complexity than existing metrics in the domain of video synopsis. To improve accuracy, an interpolation algorithm is also proposed to reconstruct broken object tubes caused by detection or segmentation errors, resulting in a more efficient and robust video synopsis framework.
